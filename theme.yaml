# Add all the CSS files to be included automatically when
# this theme is activated. Note that for preprocessors
# such as SCSS you can just use the extension css, even
# though the actual filename is .scss, and Leafcutter will
# figure it out.
#
# Paths are relative to this file, and should not have a
# leading slash.
# 
# The key "theme" denotes a "category" that this CSS will
# be placed in. Categories might be used as CSS media
# queries, such as "screen" or "print", but are also a
# way of controlling load order and segmenting merged files
# in a rational way.
#
# The categories that might be reasonable to use here, in
# the order they are loaded are:
# * library: extremely stable and widely-reused code like third-party libraries, will not be inlined
# * blocking: high load order, highest priority for inlining
# * theme: theme-specific code
# * all: generic location
# * screen: loaded with media="screen" directive
# * print: loaded with a media="print" directive
# * speech: loaded with a media="speech" directive
# * site: site- or section-specific code
css:
  theme:
    - theme/theme.css

# Add all the JS files to be included automatically here.
# The concept is extremely similar to the css section, and
# the categories that might be appropriate to use here are:
# * library: loads first, intended for things that are very stable, generally third-party libs
# * theme: loads after library, intended to give a section before "site" for themes
# * all: generic location
# * site: code that is highly specific to this site
js:
  theme:
    - theme/theme.js

# Add any other theme packages your theme depends on here
# Some useful packages that are available in a default
# installation are:
# * jquery
# * jquery-ui (includes theme-variable-respecting theme CSS)
# * fontawesome (only includes CSS/fonts, no JS)
# * vue
require: []

# Add any optional theme packages your theme provides here
# Each one should have a key for its name, and contain any
# necessary requires, css, or js keys, which would be
# structured the same way as the root of this file.
# 
# For example:
#
# packages:
#   my-package:
#     requires: [jquery]
#     css: [my-package.css]
packages: []
